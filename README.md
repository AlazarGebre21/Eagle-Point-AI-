# Task 1 : - Smart Text Analyzer 
 
# My Thought Process and Why my solution is the best
1. So I read the problem and identified the inputs and the outputs for the problem
2. Trying to come up with the most optimized approach, since it is a string that needs traversal it can’t be done in O(1) the minimum possible time that is required to do this question is O(N).
3. Listing all the variables, imports and functions that i am going to use
4. Writing the solution
# Every search that i make
1. While doing the solution i needed to check “ how to check if a character in python is an alphabet or not” so i searched like this “how to check if a character in python is an alphabet or not” and get into this popular website “https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-string-isalpha-method”  and found the answer.
2. And after a few minutes i wanted to check if a character is an alphanumeric or not by searching like this “how to check if a character in python is an alphanumeric” and get into this popular website “https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_isalnum.asp”
While solving the problem also i wonder if different punctuation marks and numbers would count as a letter in word formation and tried to see different sites like 
  1. https://www.reddit.com/r/ENGLISH/comments/t5ltoy/while_counting_the_words_in_the_essay_should_dots
  2. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/word-count-simple-guide-ana-mar%C3%ADa-z%C3%BAniga
		So based on this sources i decided to count numbers but not punctuation markers in the word formation



# Task 2 Async Data Fetcher with Retry 
# My thought Process, every search i made and the Solution
1. I divided the problem into subproblems
2. First subproblem is to do the retry of the fetch max time
3. Second subproblem is to do the wait(1sec) upon retry
4. First i searched if there are already solved problems just like this so that i can learn from that and suddenly i landed on a blog that is dedicated for this problem
“https://dev.to/ycmjason/javascript-fetch-retry-upon-failure-3p6g”

5. But that doesn’t wait 1 sec to retry so i searched how to wait some amount of time before fetch requesting, and got this 
“https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69893226/fetch-data-from-api-every-second”
6. I see how they work and tried to combine their  functionality into one
